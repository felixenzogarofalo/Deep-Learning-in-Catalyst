# Deep Learning Algorithm in Catalyst
Using deep learning and reinforcement learning in a Enigma Catalyst algorithm.

In this algorithm, implemented in Enigma Catalyst, is used Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Portfolio Management. 
For the actor-critic agent is used a Convolutional Neural Network architecture based in Jiang, Xyu and Liang work.

The algorithm is implemented in Enigma Catalyst using Poloniex Exchange data. Catalyst is based in Zipline which is the base code for Quantopian platform. This make easy extrapolate the algorithm for these recognized platforms.

Before executing the algorithm you will need to install Catalyst in first place. You can use the [Catalyst installation instruccions](https://enigma.co/catalyst/install.html).
